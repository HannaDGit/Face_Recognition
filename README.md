     We evaluate all methods on two datasets  on the face verification task.

Labeled Faces in the Wild is a public benchmark for face verification, also known as pair matching, a database of face photographs designed for studying the problem of unconstrained face recognition.
The Labeled Faces in the Wild (LFW) database was published in 2007 and is described in a University of Massachusetts,  Amherst. The database was designed to study the specific task in which a pair of two face images are presented, and a classifier is required to classify the pair as either “same” or “different” depending upon whether the images picture the same person or not. The data set contains more than 13,233 images of faces (5749 people ) collected from the web. Each face has been labeled with the name of the person pictured. 1680 of the people pictured have two or more distinct photos in the data set. The only constraint on these faces is that they were detected by the Viola-Jones face detector.
